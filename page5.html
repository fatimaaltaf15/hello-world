		<h1>Managing Your Luxury</h1>
    <p>A home is incomplete without a soul and it is believed that a Carpet from Kashmir “brings the entire house together” into a unified whole. The Carpets of Kashmir have a history around the world, acclaimed and renowned for their finish and exclusive designs, cherished as a treasure in every home.</p>
    <p>All Kashmir Carpets are hand woven by tying knots on the warp strands. There are different types of knots used in carpet weaving mostly symmetrical and asymmetrical, the latter being the most commonly used one. The value of the carpet is directly proportional to the number of knots in the carpet.</p>
    <h2>Take care of your Carpets</h2>
    <h3>Take off your shoes!</h3>
    <p>The best way to keep your luxury carpet clean is to take off your shoes. Let your bare feet feel the softness of the premium silk from Kashmir. Use clean indoor slippers on your carpets that will reduce your carpet cleaning time.</p>
    <h3>Regular Vacuum</h3>
    <p>A regular vacuum will ensure the life and cleanliness of your carpet.</p>
    <h3>Remove Stains Immediately</h3>
    <p>Do not wait for the stain to soak in! Get immediately to it; apply the wiping agent directly to the stain. Let it stand for 10 seconds and then blot it away. Do not wipe it, as that will only spread the stain. Always use a sponge with clean water to remove stains.</p>
    <h3>Professional Cleaning</h3>
    <p>Go for a professional carpet washing and cleaning every year or two.</p>
